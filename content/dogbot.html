<h2>DogBot</h2>
<p>Experimenting reinforcement learning on a playable character</p>
</header>


idea - high level character control
idea - basic learned actions controlled by a bigger "brain"
basic input -  forward, backward, left, right, jump crouch

training
	- collect pink objects
		- binary reward {0,1}
	- reach stand pink pads
		- inside time reward
	- visual observation
	- forward bias
	- continuous action space (-1,1)
		- network output scaling
	- discrete action space {backward, stand, walk, trot, run}, {left, straight, right}
		- forward bias on reward
	- puppo like
		- high level discrete actions
		- vector observations of direction, distance, borders and velocity
	- environment
		- difficult
			- # items
			- size
			- possible actions
	- reward
		- shape behavior
			- binary
			- increasing
			- time penalty
			- action penalty
		- forward bias
		- difficult to attain the desired end result
	- result
		- puppo like
			- works good, "complete" information of ambient
		- visual observation
			- partial information
			- movement tied to vision, lack of attention
			- independent action branches, hard to train together
			- nonoptimal behavior, forward overfit
		- generalization
			- object shape (because of color?)
			- area size
